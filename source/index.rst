UnoAPI: Modern Parallel C++ Programming with SYCL and oneAPI
==============================================================

.. note:: We thank Intel Corporation and the wonderful team behind OneAPI and Data Parallel C++ for their support of our open source lecture materials. 
   We do not have funding to continue our work but hope that the ideas will endure well into the future.
   Please don't hesitate to get in touch with `George K. Thiruvathukal <https://gkt.sh>`__ if you have any questions.


This is a tutorial on oneAPI (based on SYCL), a promising direction to support modern high-performance computing on heterogeneous architectures using the C++ language and its ever-improving ecosystem.

Please get started by reading :doc:`00-preliminaries/preliminaries`.
