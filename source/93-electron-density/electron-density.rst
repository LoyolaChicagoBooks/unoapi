Electron Density Case Study
============================

.. note:: This is the electron density chapter that is being led by Raymundo, Alvaro, and Jorge


In quantum chemistry, vector fields are critical tools that describe how quantities associated with the electron density, such as forces and velocity fields, vary within a molecular system. These fields are integral to understanding and predicting the behavior of electrons in molecules, which in turn influences molecular stability, reactivity, and interactions.
