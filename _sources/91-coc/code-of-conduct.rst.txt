Code of Conduct
=================

.. note:: The current plan is to follow the well-researched (and apparently successful) `Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct <https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/>`__. Although this particular effort is C++ focused, a subset of us are actively involved in Python work and view the Python community as the platinum standard when it comes to its community.

   Unless we see a need to create our own standard, we will follow the Python community standards. We will establish an ombundsperson (as opposed to ombundsman) to field any potential concerns. Nevertheless, we hold ourselves to the highest standards and hope never to be in a situation where our ethics, morals, and values are compromised.
