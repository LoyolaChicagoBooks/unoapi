Parallel Programming Preliminaries
==================================

Brief History of Data Parallelism
----------------------------------

.. note:: This is an approximate lineage (not finalized)!

- Vector machines (Cray)

- Connection Machine (Thinking Machines)

- Systolic architectures

- Loop parallelism in FORTRAN

- C* and Data-Parallel C efforts

- CUDA

- OpenMP

- oneAPI

Parallel Concepts for Humans
------------------------------

.. note:: The track for this was laid in the Java threads/networking book.

- von Neumann machines and their limits

- Flynn's taxonomy

- Control-memory taxonomy

- Speedup vs. Efficiency

- Strong/Weak scaling [new topic]

- Granularity

- OS challenges of starvation, deadlock

- Flooding/Throttling

- Latency

- Scheduling [needed for understanding q.submit()]

- task graphs / dataflow execution / macro-dataflow concept
