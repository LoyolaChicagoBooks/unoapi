Preliminaries
================

.. note::

   This is an "about the book" chapter.

Motivation
-----------

This is not all-inclusive.

Tenets:

- Who are the next generation of research software engineers who want to consider HPC careers?
- Most graduates drawn to modern web development, data science, and machine learning jobs. 
- While all are wonderful jobs, this is a lost opportunity, as most of the modern/hip languages are designed for improving how we *solve problems*.
- Most graduates learning about *cool* languages that offer higher-order thinking, e.g. Scala, Go, Rust, and numerous scripting languages.

But...

- HPC itself is still cool. Where else can you have access to so many cores and novel architectures?
- The most modern languages still *punt to C* to provide acceleration.
- Research software engineers who know about *computer systems* and *software engineering* are most likely to progress by embracing these two areas (computer systems and SE)




Topics
-----------

These are the planned chapters:

- Parallel Programming Principles
- Development Environment [minimum friction approaches]
- Software Engineering
- Modern C++ as a Better C/C++
- Data Parallel C++
- Multicore Programming
- Working with Devices
- Going Distributed
- Performance Evalution
