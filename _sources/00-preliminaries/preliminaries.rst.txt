About the Book
================

This is tutorial on Modern C++ and OneAPI/SYCL.
Although a work in progress, key chapters and examples are beginning to be available.

Motivation for Our Work
-------------------------

This is not all-inclusive.

Tenets:

- Who are the next generation of research software engineers who want to consider HPC careers?
- Most graduates drawn to modern web development, data science, and machine learning jobs. 
- While all are wonderful jobs, this is a lost opportunity, as most of the modern/hip languages are designed for improving how we *solve problems*.
- Most graduates learning about *cool* languages that offer higher-order thinking, e.g. Scala, Go, Rust, and numerous scripting languages.

But...

- HPC itself is still cool. Where else can you have access to so many cores and novel architectures?
- The most modern languages still *punt to C* to provide acceleration.
- Research software engineers who know about *computer systems* and *software engineering* are most likely to progress by embracing these two areas (computer systems and SE)
